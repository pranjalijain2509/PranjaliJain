		<li><h3>What is a Blog?<h3></li>
			<p>
				A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.
			</p>
		<li><h3>What is the purpose of a blog?</h3></li>
		<p>There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility.</p>
<!-- <p style="color:blue;"> -->
	<p>
As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.
		</p>
		<li><h3>Blog structure</h3></li>
		<p>The appearance of blogs has changed over time, and these days blogs include a wide variety of items and widgets. However, most blogs still include some standard features and structures.</p>
<p>
Here are common features that a typical blog will include:
		</p>

		<ul type="circle">
			<li>Header with the menu or navigation bar.

			</li>
			<li class="hi">
				Main content area with highlighted or latest blog posts.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<hr>
	<ol>
		<li>
			item1
			<ul type="square">
				<li class="hi">cap</li>
				<li class="hi">shoes</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		item2</li>
	</ol>
